-- Purpose of this script is for a CC Tweaked Minecraft Turtle to run through
-- a quarry and bring back all the interesting blocks. Whether they are interesting
-- is user-defined but essentially is aimed at the user defining the blocks
-- to ignore (leave as entities) and bring back everything else.
